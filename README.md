mil_millington_rss
==================

Converts Mil Millington's tweets into an RSS feed so I don't miss a Mil's Mail

I also have never had a project or coded with github before! So lots of firsts here!

Dependencies (python libraries):
twitter (pip install twitter)

TODO:
-convert URLs that appear in the tweets to links
-title of RSS entry should link to enclosed link
