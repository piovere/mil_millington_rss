#mil_millington_rss

Converts Mil Millington's tweets into an RSS feed so I don't miss a Mil's Mail

I also have never had a project or coded with github before! So lots of firsts here!

##Dependencies (python libraries):
* [twitter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter) (pip install twitter)
* [PyRSS2Gen](http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html) (pip install PyRSS2Gen)

##TODO:
* convert URLs that appear in the tweets to links
* title of RSS entry should link to enclosed link
